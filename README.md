# DeepLearning-_TF
The next code presents a new model hybrid to Predict Transcription Factors.

It has the next architecture:
a) A 4CNN Module
b) A BiLSTM Module
C) A Attetion Mechanism Module



The metrics reach out in this model, no present overfitting and we report the next table results:


To Download Data, you can see the Data Dir, and you find:

a) AN: Aspergillus nidulans, genome and true predictions from DeepReg

b) NC: Neurospora crassa, genome and true predictions from DeepReg

c) SC: Saccharomyces cerevisiae, genome and true predictions from DeepReg

d) ListID_TFs: The ID List from UNIPROT Swissprot Database to create training DB of TF
